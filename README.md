# Time Capsule
Created as a part of RocketSeat's NLW 2023. This is a time capsule app that allows users to login with their GitHub accounts and register their memories via a combination of photos and texts. 
The app runs both on mobile and web. 

It was made in `React.Js`, `React Native`, `TypeScript` on the front-end, with styling is handled by `Tailwind`. On the backend, `Fastify` was used to create the server, `Prisma` for the database and `Axios` for routing. `OAuth` is used for authenitcation.
